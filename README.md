# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. Two players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 board. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the board is filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is declared a tie.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to enter their move (row and column) as two numbers separated by a space.
3. The board positions are indexed from 0 to 2.
4. The first player is assigned 'X' and the second player 'O'.
5. The game ends when a player wins by placing three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full resulting in a tie.
6. After a game ends, players have the option to play again.
